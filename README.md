## Key Concepts Used

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Encapsulation (Service layer abstracts DB logic)

Composition (main app uses services)

Modularity and separation of concerns


SQLite

Lightweight DB with auto table creation

CRUD operations for students, courses, and enrollments


CLI Interface

Text-based interactive prompts for smooth user experience

##💡 Future Enhancements

Add GUI (Tkinter or Web-based with Flask)

Add student grades and report generation

Export to CSV/Excel

Role-based access and authentication

REST API support
